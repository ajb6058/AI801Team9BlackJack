#                           TO DO
# --Create a "Deck" Class
#   --Deck class will include a deck function that will build the deck and be called to "re-build" the deck once the deck gets too low
# --Create a "Initial Hand" class
#   --Initial hand can be used for both house and agent, but may be tricky if they are not their own functions, 
#     this will require additional testing
# --Create an agent
#   --Currently, the "agent" values are hard-coded, but an agent will be needed to play the game
# --Create a script for testing/learning
# --Look for alternative solution for nested if-else statements (dynamic based on deck size preferred)
# --Nest the while loop to continue to run and shuffle the deck
#   --Run a test to see how many games are played before busting
# --Run a test with hitting every time
# --Run a test with different bet values as the default
